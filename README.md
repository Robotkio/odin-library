# odin-library
The library assignment from the Odin Project used to practice prototyping and vague, OOP practice.

Major failing so far: 
- It redraws the whole list of books when you check or uncheck the "read" icon.
- I can't tell what element is causing the width of the drawing frame to expand so I get a horizontal scroll bar sometimes.
